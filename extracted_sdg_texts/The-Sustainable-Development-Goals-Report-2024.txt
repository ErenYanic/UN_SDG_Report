Developing and vulnerable countries face vast development challenges.
Per capita growth in gross domestic product (GDP) in half the world’s
most vulnerable countries is now slower than in advanced economies for
the first time this century. This trajectory threatens to reverse a long-term
trend towards more income equality among countries. Furthermore, after
a decade of rapid debt accumulation, the external debt stock in low- and
middle-income countries remains at unprecedentedly high levels. The SDG
investment gap in developing countries now stands at $4 trillion per year.
These problems are exacerbated by the fact that developing countries are
inadequately represented in global economic decision-making, with their
voting share falling far short of their membership in many international
financial institutions.

9 Goal 1 | No poverty
Zero hunger
• After rising sharply in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, global
hunger and food insecurity remained persistently high and almost
unchanged for three years. In 2023, about 733 million people faced
hunger, and 2.33 billion people experienced moderate to severe food
insecurity. Despite progress, 148 million children under age 5 suffered
from stunting in 2022. If current trends persist, one in five children under
age 5 will be affected by stunting in 2030.

The use of geographic regions as the basis for country groupings is a major
change from The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2016 and the progress
reports on the Millennium Development Goals. Previously, data were
presented for countries in “developed” and “developing” regions, which
were further broken down into geographic subregions. Although there is no
established convention for the designation of “developed” and “developing”
countries or areas in the United Nations system, data for some indicators
in this report are still being presented for developed and developing regions
and countries for the purpose of statistical analysis only, and are based on
the practice employed by the international agencies that provided the data.6
