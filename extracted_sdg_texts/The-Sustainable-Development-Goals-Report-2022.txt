No poverty
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put steady
progress in poverty reduction over the past 25 years into reverse,
with the number of people in extreme poverty increasing for the first
time in a generation. Now, rising inflation and the impacts of the war
in Ukraine may derail progress further. The combined crises could
lead to an additional 75 million to 95 million people living in extreme
poverty in 2022, compared with pre-pandemic projections. While

numbers of vulnerable people have not yet benefited from them. As
things stand, the world is not on track to end poverty by 2030, with
poorer countries now needing unprecedented levels of pro-poor
growth to achieve this goal.
First COVID-19 and now the Ukraine crisis are derailing progress on ending extreme poverty
Between 2015 and 2018, global poverty continued its historical decline, world even further from meeting the target of ending extreme poverty
with the extreme poverty rate falling from 10.1 per cent to 8.6 per cent. by 2030.

Zero hunger
The world is on the verge of a global food crisis, with a rising number
of people experiencing hunger and food insecurity even before the
COVID-19 pandemic. Global food supply systems have been partially
undermined by a cascading combination of growing conflicts,
climate-related shocks and widening inequalities. As a result, as
many as 828 million people may have suffered from hunger in 2021.

Gender equality
The world is not on track to achieve gender equality by 2030, and

on unpaid care and domestic work, decision-making regarding sexual
and reproductive health, and gender-responsive budgeting, is falling
behind. Women’s health services, already poorly funded, have faced
major disruptions. Violence against women remains endemic. And

trends. Those with relatively low incomes are at risk of falling
behind. The pandemic has also intensified structural and systemic

harder than ever to recover economically. With the pandemic far from
