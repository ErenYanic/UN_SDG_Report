End poverty in all its

Even before the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, progress
towards Goal 1 had slowed, and the world was not on track to ending
extreme poverty by 2030. Now, as the world anticipates the worst
economic fallout since the Great Depression, tens of millions of
people will be pushed back into poverty, undoing years of steady
improvement. As the economic impacts of the pandemic begin to be ever. So, too, is the need for effective emergency preparedness, both

Eradicating hunger and achieving food security remains a challenge,
more so in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis. At the global level, hunger
and food insecurity have been on the rise, and malnutrition still
affects millions of children. The situation is likely to get worse owing to
economic slowdowns and disruptions caused by a pandemic-triggered
recession. In addition to COVID-19, the desert locust upsurge in six mitigate the threats posed by the pandemic to vulnerable populations,
Eastern African countries and Yemen – where 35 million people are countries need to take immediate action to keep trade flowing, to
already experiencing acute food insecurity – remains alarming. To strengthen food supply chains and to increase agricultural production.
Recent increases in food insecurity are likely to worsen as a result of COVID-19
Since 2014, the global prevalence of undernourishment (chronic purchasing power and the capacity to produce and distribute food,
food insecurity) has remained virtually unchanged at slightly below which affects the most vulnerable populations. In 2020, up to

Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region with the highest under-5
mortality rate: in 2018, 1 in 13 children died before reaching age 5.
That is 16 times higher than the average in high-income countries.
By 2018, 121 countries had already met the SDG target on under-5
mortality, and 21 countries are expected to do so by 2030. However,
progress will need to accelerate in 53 countries, two thirds of which
are in sub-Saharan Africa.
As the COVID-19 epidemic continues to erode health systems, disrupt
routine health services and constrain access to nutritious diets and
essential nutrition services, hundreds of thousands of additional
under-5 deaths are expected in 2020, along with tens of thousands
of additional maternal deaths. According to a recent study, if routine health care is disrupted and access to food is decreased, the increase in child and maternal deaths could be devastating: 118 low- and
middle-income countries could see an increase of 9.8 to 44.8 per cent
in under-5 deaths per month and an 8.3 to 38.6 per cent rise in
maternal deaths per month, over a period of six months.

The COVID-19 pandemic spotlights the need for reliable and affordable

showed that one quarter of health facilities surveyed were not

which affected their capacity for essential health services. Damage

Access to credit is particularly important to small-scale firms for

small-scale industries (manufacturing and services) benefit from loans

Income inequality is falling in some countries, but levels generally remain high
The Gini index is one of the most commonly used measures of Gini index for disposable income (or consumption expenditure) by country,
income inequality. It ranges between 0 and 100, where 0 indicates around 2010 and 2017
that income is shared equally among all people and 100 indicates the 70
extreme situation where one person accounts for all income. Among
the 84 countries with available data, the Gini index for disposable 60
income (or consumption expenditure) fell by at least one point in
38 countries between 2010 and 2017, meaning those countries saw

Most regions still have a long way to go in establishing adequate migration policies
Globally, 54 per cent of countries have a comprehensive set of policy
measures to facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration
and mobility of people, based on 111 countries with available data
in September 2019. This means that they reported having policy
measures in place for at least 80 per cent of the subcategories that
make up the six policy domains of this indicator. Central and Southern
Asia (80 per cent) and Latin America and the Caribbean (79 per cent)
have the highest share of countries with a comprehensive set of
policies, compared with just 33 per cent of countries in both Oceania
and in Northern Africa and Western Asia.
Across the six domains, policies to promote cooperation and
partnerships and to facilitate safe, orderly and regular migration are
most widespread, with more than three quarters of Governments
reporting that they met or fully met the criteria. Migrant rights
and their socioeconomic well-being have the lowest proportions
of Governments reporting a wide range of policy measures, at

Fixed-broadband subscriptions have nearly doubled over the last
decade – from 7.6 per 100 inhabitants in 2010 to 14.9 in 2019.
That year, fixed-broadband connections (1.1 billion) outnumbered fixed-telephone connections (931 million). Developed countries had
33.6 subscriptions per 100 inhabitants in 2019, while developing
countries had a third of that amount, at 11.2 subscriptions. LDCs had
almost no fixed-broadband connections owing to the high cost and
lack of infrastructure.
While the need for sound data continues to escalate, poorer countries lack the resources to produce them
In 2019, most countries reported that they were carrying out
a national statistical plan (141 countries, up from 129 in 2018).
However, many also said that they lacked sufficient funding for
full implementation. Only 25 per cent of plans were fully funded in
sub-Saharan Africa (9 out of 36 countries), compared with 95 per cent
(36 out of 38 countries) in Europe and Northern America.
From 2016 to 2017, ODA for data and statistics rose by 11 per cent,
from $623 million to $690 million, but this was only 0.34 per cent
of total ODA. International funding for data and statistics is about
half the level it needs to be. Over the past three years, countries
in sub-Saharan Africa benefited most, receiving $885 million, a
significant increase in funding. Continued and increased technical
and financial support is needed to ensure that countries in developing
regions are better equipped to monitor progress of their national
development agendas.

Progress summary for SDG targets with a 2020 deadline
By the end of 2020, 21 of the 169 Sustainable Development Goal targets will have matured. This summary reviews progress made towards those
targets at the global level based on available data as of June 2020. It takes stock of how far the world has come in meeting these commitments
by mid-2020 and provides an assessment in stoplight colours. Of these 21 targets, 12 are linked to the United Nations Convention on Biological
Diversity Aichi Biodiversity Targets. The biodiversity-linked SDG targets are grouped together on this page.
