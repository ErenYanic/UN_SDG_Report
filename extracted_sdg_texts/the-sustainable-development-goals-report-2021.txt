other strategies can make statistical capacity-building more effective
and sustainable. A study of national statistical training programmes
in 15 countries, led by the Global Network of Institutes for Statistical
Training (GIST), showed that many countries have been proactive in
identifying training needs and offering training opportunities for their
staff. Among the lessons learned, one stands out: a key element in
effective capacity-building is to set priorities by internal needs, rather
than those driven by external partners. Areas that are in high demand

assessment and encouraged development partners to deliver
trainings that were in line with internal needs.
Improving data and metadata access
To support a rapid and effective response to a crisis, comprehensive
and integrated data must be readily available, easy to find and able
to be shared publicly, as appropriate. During the pandemic, many
countries provided public dashboards with daily updates to monitor
the spread of the disease. Some also provided greater access to utility
data, such as the location of essential services, including supermarkets,
pharmacies and petrol stations, as in the case of Mexico.
Open national data platforms for the SDGs have been adopted by
many countries, allowing them to better meet the needs of a wide
range of users. The National Statistical Committee of Kyrgyzstan was
one of the pioneers. Its SDG platform makes use of Open SDG, an
open-source data platform solution developed in part by the Office
for National Statistics of the United Kingdom and implemented with
support from the UNSD-FCDO project on SDG monitoring.

The effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic
have reversed much of the progress made in reducing poverty, with
global extreme poverty rising in 2020 for the first time since the Asian
financial crisis of the late 1990s. Even before COVID-19, the world was
not on track to achieve the goal of ending poverty by 2030, and without
immediate and significant action, it will remain beyond reach. The crisis

27 Goal 1 | No poverty
End hunger, achieve
food security and
improved nutrition and
promote sustainable
agriculture
Just prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, close to 700 million people
were going hungry, and some 2 billion people were suffering from
food insecurity – figures that had been rising since 2014. The crisis
has posed additional threats to global food security and nutrition.
Disrupted food supply chains and economic slowdowns have affected
food systems worldwide and threatened people’s access to food,
making the target of ending hunger even more distant. COVID-19
is expected to exacerbate all forms of malnutrition, particularly in
children, due to a loss of household income, a lack of available and
affordable nutritious food, reduced physical activity and disruptions in
essential nutrition services. Even discounting the effects of COVID-19,
around 230 million children suffer from malnutrition. Urgent short-
term actions are needed to avert rising hunger, and a transformation
of food systems is required to achieve a healthy and sustainable food
future for all.
COVID‑19 is pushing rising rates of hunger and food insecurity even higher
An estimated 690 million people suffered from hunger in 2019 widening social inequities, an altered food environment and price
(8.9 per cent of the world’s population), up by nearly 60 million over hikes. Between 83 million and 132 million additional people globally are

The social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have

women and girls has intensified; child marriage, on the decline in

disproportionate share of job losses and increased care work at home.
